Compiling module org.dominokit.website.AppClientModule
   Unification traversed 4376 fields and methods and 675 types. 4 are considered part of the current module and 399 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([org.dominokit.website.layout.client.views.ui.HomeViewImpl$lambda$0$Type]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
