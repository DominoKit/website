Compiling module org.dominokit.website.AppClientModule
   Unification traversed 4353 fields and methods and 654 types. 2 are considered part of the current module and 397 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([org.dominokit.website.layout.client.views.ui.components.TypeSafetyComponent$lambda$0$Type]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
